SwitchTower is an iOS game for directing trains through a set of track.

The game is intended to be partially realistic.  The game uses
real track arrangements and traffic levels.  However, the task being done
is often a mix of what real (American) railroads would do in a switch tower
at a junction, at a CTC machine when dispatching over long distances, or on
the ground throwing switches in a yard or station.

Switch Tower is still under development; please <a href="https://github.com/bowdidge">contact me</a> if you're interested in working on the game.
