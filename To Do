Do today:
[x] Implement becomes.
[x] Convert remaining scenarios to plists.

Polish / Bugs
[ ] Better sounds.
[ ] don't allow changing switch along route.'
[ ] Reversing signal back to red clears all routes.
[X] Reverse Diridon for correct west/east.
[x] Way to quit game.
[x] Train reaching end isn't disappearing.
[x] don't arrange new train at entry til old one goes.
[x] Use table view for selecting initial game.
[x] Implement AlertView.

Game play
[ ] Handle multiple step switching moves better.
[x] Improve one game (Diridon?  16th Street?) for playability.
[ ] Detect illegal moves, and put up popover describing problem ("no freight trains on pass 2-4")
[ ] Don't allow switch thrown under train.
[ ] Warn about why signal can't be changed.
[ ] Turning a signal back to red should clear route only to previous signal.
[ ] Only allow changing signal in with multi-minute lock.
[x] Allow different length blocks.
[x] Correctly time how long through blocks.
[ ] Allow acceleration and deceleration.  (3ft/sec/sec accel)
[ ] Switch position to be distance from the left hand side.  Makes calculating distance to stop much easier.
[ ] How to make slow parts of game interesting?
[ ] Be able to mark which locs aren't allowed for freights.  Perhaps have idea of classes of trains to make logic easier?'
[ ] Fast forward button to skip ahead to next action.
[ ] Set up stops for passenger trains.

[ ] Allow wraparound paths.
[ ] Allow prompting for taking stretch of track for an interval (think yard switching)
[ ] Draw timetable directly in Cocoa, add human touches like circling / crossing out trains, using highlighter to mark current station, etc.

[ ] Infer possible exits, and warn when a direction would send a train the wrong way.
[ ] Add bar at the top of the screen that can change color when alerts happen - to show longer distance.
[x] Handle timetable for trains changing names.
[x] Drum beat only when scheduled train delayed.
[x] Generate timetable from schedule.
[x] Make timetable part of scenario.

[ ] Finish list of banned points.  Requires being notified by LayoutModel of named points passed through.


Scenarios:
[ ] Make at least one new scenario.
[ ] Oakland 16th Street
[ ] Oakland Pier.
[ ] Bakersfield tower.

Scenario editor:
[ ] Implement sooner to make easier to improve playability?
[ ] Gear on main screen goes to scenario editor screen - identical except for label changes.
[ ] Scenario editor should have tabbed view for different aspects, layout view allows dragging tiles one by one from palette (drag of existing tile on screen makes line.)

Timetable
[x] Timetable should be based on all trains in scenario, not active trains.
[x] timetable needs to be in time order.

Programming
[ ] Improve testing.

Cahill:
[ ] Cahill's track 4/5 have the longest platform and should be used for longer distance trains.
[ ] Coast Mail should stop on track 1 for easier unloading.

Notes about development

Is this a tower game, or a CTC game?  What'l be more fun?


TO DO:
Don't allow invalid / n

[ ] Points and scoring.
[ ] Figure out timing.
[ ] For Diridon, grab a real schedule from late '30's / late '50's' and see how that works.
[ ] For timing, set lengths of tracks along x axis, calculate speed, do everything based on distance from LHS.
[ ] Semi-autonomous switchers for handling cars, forcing back and forth movements.
[ ] More game-like scenarios.
[ ] Other scenarios.  Can handle crossings?  Maybe Redwood Junction or Santa Clara tower?
[ ] Different speeds.
