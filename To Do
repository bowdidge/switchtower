Polish
[ ] Use table view for selecting initial game.
[ ] Better sounds.
[ ] Way to quit game.

Bugs:
[ ] Train reaching end isn't disappearing.
[ ] don't arrange new train at entry til old one goes.
[ ] don't allow changing switch along route.'
[ ] Reversing signal back to red clears all routes.

Game play
[ ] Handle multiple step switching moves better.
[ ] Improve one game (Diridon) for playability.
[ ] Generate timetable from schedule.
[ ] Detect illegal moves, and put up popover describing problem ("no freight trains on pass 2-4")
[ ] Don't allow switch thrown under train.
[ ] Drum beat only when scheduled train delayed.
[ ] Warn about why signal can't be changed.
[ ] Turning a signal back to red should clear route only to previous signal.
[ ] Only allow changing signal in with multi-minute lock.
[ ] Allow different length blocks.
[ ] Correctly time how long through blocks.
[ ] How to make slow parts of game interesting?

[ ] Make timetable part of model.

[ ] Need speedup to skip ahead to next action.

Scenarios:
[ ] Make at least one new scenario.
[ ] Oakland Pier.
[ ] Bakersfield tower.

Timetable
[ ] Timetable should be based on all trains in scenario, not active trains.

Programming
[ ] Improve testing.


Notes about development

Is this a tower game, or a CTC game?  What'l be more fun?


TO DO:
Don't allow invalid / n

[ ] Points and scoring.
[ ] Figure out timing.
[ ] For Diridon, grab a real schedule from late '30's and see how that works.
[ ] For timing, set lengths of tracks along x axis, calculate speed, do everything based on distance from LHS.
[ ] Semi-autonomous switchers for handling cars, forcing back and forth movements.
[ ] More game-like scenarios.
[ ] Other scenarios.  Can handle crossings?  Maybe Redwood Junction or Santa Clara tower?
[ ] Different speeds.
