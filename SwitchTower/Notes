Notes about development

Is this a tower game, or a CTC game?  What'l be more fun?


TO DO:
Don't allow invalid / n

[ ] Points and scoring.
[ ] Figure out timing.  
  [ ] For Diridon, grab a real schedule from late '30's and see how that works.
  [ ] For timing, set lengths of tracks along x axis, calculate speed, do everything based on distance from LHS.
[ ] Semi-autonomous switchers for handling cars, forcing back and forth movements.
[ ] More game-like scenarios.
[ ] Other scenarios.  Can handle crossings?  Maybe Redwood Junction or Santa Clara tower?
[ ] Different speeds.
